Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this website I present three (actually two) of my favourite writers of all time: Carver, Faulkner and Capote (shown as 'under-construction').

These are the main files included:
 - index.html: Main page that presents all the writers and gives access to the rest of pages
 - carver.html: Page devoted to Raymond Carver
 - faulkner.html: Page devoted to William Faulkner
 - capote.html: Page devoted to Truman Capote (shown as 'under-construction')
 - style.css: Main CSS stylesheet generated by compilation of file style.scss
 - style.scss: Main Sass stylesheet that is compiled onto file style.css
 - Several .png and .jpg files: Images and logo shown on the page
